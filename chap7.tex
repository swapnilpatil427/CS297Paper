\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this project, we implemented multi language environment support for browser.
 It helps developers to have flexibility in programming web pages in various different langauges. As Increased demand for computation in browser, and availability of various different languages in the market, makes it critical to have support for multi langauge support for browser. The libraries designed as part of this project, will help developer to program in langauges like Scheme, and Lua. 
 
 Although, having multiple languages at the time has its own complexities, there are various new research opportunities possible. 

As the future work, we would like to expand these libraries to have complete functionality to access DOM APIs. We would like to add support for garbage collection, data conversions, etc. We would also like to explore the approach similar to CLR/JVM.
