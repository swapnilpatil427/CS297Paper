\chapter{Conclusion and Future Work}

In this project, we implemented multi-language environment support for the browser.
 It helps developers to have flexibility in programming web pages in various different languages. And increased demand for computation in browser and availability of various different languages in the market, makes it critical to have support for multi-language support for the browser. The libraries designed as part of this project will help developer to program in languages like Scheme and Lua. 
 
 Although, having multiple languages at the time has its own complexities, there are various new research opportunities possible. 

As a future work, we would like to expand these libraries to have complete functionality to access DOM APIs. We would like to explore the approach similar to CLR/JVM.
