I would like to express my sincere gratitude to my advisor, Dr. Thomas Austin,
who expertly guided me through my graduate education and my masterâ€™s project.
His constant mentorship, advice and support helped me to move in a
right direction towards completion of the project. I would like to thank him for his time, help and efforts towards me and this project.

My deep gratitude also goes to Dr.  Katerina Potika and Dr. Robert Chun for
being on my defense committee. I would like to thank them for their time and efforts.
Lastly, I would like to thank my friends and family. They supported and helped me
to survive this stress and not letting me give up.
